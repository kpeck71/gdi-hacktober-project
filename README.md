Pick Pet
- Create separate containers for cats and dogs, and load the images in the relevant container
- When you hover over one of the cards, use CSS animation to make the entire card larger
transform: scale(2)

- Show a "Pick Pet" button to select which pet you want to use.
- Question: Does a random cat/dog appear as the computer's player?--What if they could pick their own pet from a list of images?(Amanda)
- Save the pet and its details (name, image, etc) to be the Current Player
- Leaderboard maybe? To show your score vs everyone else whose played - not sure how to actually do this but that would be a cool function for the user to see? Thoughts? (Amanda)

More advanced: Add Experience
- Add a way for pets to grow their experience
- If they 'train', they get higher experience points. The more points you have, the stronger you are and are more likely to beat the opponent

Konami Code
- Easter egg: If you enter the Konami code, you will automatically win
- Alternative: Enter Konami code, a wild mongoose comes in and beats everyone! (See Youtube video for mongoose reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TPn1-SJqVM

Play Game
- After selecting your player, the 'choose player' cat and dog sections are automatically hidden and you see the 2 cards, plus a game board between the two cards
- CSS animations - cards crashing in to each other when they play game


Winning
- Change alert("game over") to a more fun animation/visual
- Show who has won, either Computer or the player
